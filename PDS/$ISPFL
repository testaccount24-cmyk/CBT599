Thanks Bill, what a neat little exec.

I took the liberty of changing it in light of further discussions
and the fact that I use a 132-wide screen.  Here's my amended
effort:

I know that the "session" panel will display the version of ISPF
that is executing. Is that data also available to via a
profile/shared variable? If not does anyone have the control
block chain to the data?

easier to parse too.

Robin,

To see the values of the shared pool variables people are
mentioning, navigate to ISPF 7.3 - Variables. You will see them
in the "S" (Shared) column.

no problem.  I did receive several mentions of a larger screen.
But since I usually stay with mod 4 (80 wide)....

Thanks for the clarification Doug.  If that is true, then the
wording I quoted (which is in every ISPF manual in the "changes"
section) should be modified.

"The ZENVIR variable is used by IBM personnel for internal
purposes."
<snip>

This sure makes it sound like it's something the customer is not
supposed to use - or not supposed to use any longer since it is
in the changes section. It could never be obsoleted by ZISPFOS
anyway since it contains more information than just the internal
release number.

If I recall, the idea for the new vars was to find a way to get
ISPF version numbers to be more in line with the OS version with
which they ship.  But the ZENVIR variable is used by too many
programs out there to have its function change.  If nothing else,
it is, like so many other mainframe things, defined by convention
and compatibility considerations.
